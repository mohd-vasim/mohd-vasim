### Profile Summary

> Senior AI Engineer with experience in **Agentic AI**, **LLM-driven automation**, and **AI system design** for enterprise ERP environments. Skilled in architecting scalable AI workflows, building intelligent agents, integrating cloud-native infrastructure, and fine-tuning open-source LLMs for production.
> Proven ability to deliver **end-to-end AI solutions** — from dataset creation and model training to deployment, monitoring, and optimization. Passionate about creating intelligent autonomous systems that improve productivity and business decision-making.


I work as an AI and Machine Learning Engineer, building intelligent systems that have to survive real constraints — business logic, latency, cost, and long-term maintainability. My work today revolves around agentic AI, LLM-driven automation, and designing systems that are expected to reason, act, and adapt inside enterprise environments rather than remain as isolated demos.

I didn’t arrive here through a traditional engineering path. My academic background is in commerce, where I completed a Bachelor of Commerce with a specialization in computers. That transition shaped how I think: I care deeply about clarity, fundamentals, and usefulness. I’m less interested in buzzwords and more interested in understanding why systems behave the way they do, especially when theory meets production.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked across the full lifecycle of AI systems — from framing ambiguous business problems, preparing datasets, and fine-tuning open-source language models, to deploying and monitoring AI workflows in production. Much of my current work involves agentic architectures: systems that use tools, memory, and structured reasoning to automate complex workflows within ERP platforms. These are environments where mistakes are costly and reliability matters more than novelty.

Technically, my day-to-day work is anchored in Python. I build backend services using FastAPI and Flask, work extensively with relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and rely on Redis and Docker to make systems scalable and reproducible. On the AI side, I spend most of my time with large language models — fine-tuning them, evaluating their behavior, and integrating them into larger systems using frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph. I also work across cloud platforms when the system demands it.

Alongside engineering, I write. Writing helps me slow down and understand ideas properly — whether it’s self-attention, model efficiency, architectural trade-offs, or the limits of current agentic systems. This portfolio doubles as a public notebook where I document my thinking, experiments, and lessons learned. Over time, these notes become more valuable than static skill lists because they reflect how my understanding evolves.

Professionally, I’m interested in moving closer to research-oriented thinking while staying grounded in systems that actually ship. I want to understand models deeply, but I also care about how they behave under pressure — in production, with imperfect data, and with human expectations layered on top. In the long run, I see myself building intelligent products and possibly ventures that sit at this intersection of research, engineering, and practical impact.

This page isn’t meant to be complete or final. It will change as my work changes. That’s intentional.

If you’d like to see what I’m building or thinking about, the rest of this site is a good place to start.
