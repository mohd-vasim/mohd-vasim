### Profile Summary

> Senior AI Engineer with experience in **Agentic AI**, **LLM-driven automation**, and **AI system design** for enterprise ERP environments. Skilled in architecting scalable AI workflows, building intelligent agents, integrating cloud-native infrastructure, and fine-tuning open-source LLMs for production.
> Proven ability to deliver **end-to-end AI solutions** — from dataset creation and model training to deployment, monitoring, and optimization. Passionate about creating intelligent autonomous systems that improve productivity and business decision-making.

I work as an AI and Machine Learning Engineer, building intelligent systems that have to survive real constraints — business logic, latency, cost, and long-term maintainability. My work centers on agentic AI and LLM-driven automation, designing systems that are expected to reason, act, and adapt inside enterprise environments rather than exist as isolated demos. Over the years, I’ve worked across the full lifecycle of AI systems, from framing ambiguous problems and preparing datasets to fine-tuning open-source language models and deploying production workflows where reliability matters more than novelty.

I didn’t arrive here through a traditional engineering path. I come from a commerce background, having completed a Bachelor of Commerce with a specialization in computers, and that transition strongly shaped how I think. I care deeply about clarity, fundamentals, and usefulness, and I’m less interested in buzzwords than in understanding why systems behave the way they do — especially when theoretical ideas meet real-world constraints. Technically, my work is grounded in Python, building backend services with FastAPI and Flask, working with PostgreSQL and MySQL, and using tools like Redis and Docker to make systems scalable and reproducible. Much of my current work involves agentic architectures that use tools, memory, and structured reasoning to automate complex ERP workflows.

Alongside engineering, I write. Writing helps me slow down and understand ideas properly — from self-attention and model efficiency to architectural trade-offs and the limits of current agentic systems. This portfolio is a public notebook where I document my thinking, experiments, and lessons as they evolve over time. Professionally, I’m moving toward deeper research-oriented thinking while staying grounded in systems that actually ship, with a long-term interest in building intelligent products and ventures at the intersection of research, engineering, and practical impact.

This page isn’t meant to be complete or final. It will change as my work changes. That’s intentional.

If you’d like to see what I’m building or thinking about, the rest of this site is a good place to start.
